# Tbot
This project is for me to learn how to build a crypto trader bot using automation and predifined strategies. I also want to train a trader bot using diffrent methods, for now only Linear regression but I might add more ways to do that in the future.

### Planned Features
 - [ ] Needs to read in Crypto and Stock data ands store it somewhere in the computer.
 - [ ] Needs matrix algebra e.g Inverse, Conditional Inverse, Rank, Multiplication, Addition / Subtraction and so forth.
 - [ ] Needs to be able to trade crypto (Hopefully Stock as well in the future) automaticly depending on the data collected.
 - [ ] Using the matrix algebra I want to train Models using linear regression with the LSE method and Gradient Descent.
 - [ ] I want it to be able to use backtesting using strategies and or trained models.

### Prerequisites
